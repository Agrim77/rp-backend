## Introduction

- I have made this as a submission for Richpanel interview round.
- I had to create a POC (Proof of Concept) app. This app will allow clients to connect their fb accounts, listen to their comments or messenger messages and reply to them within the application.
- This repo is for backend only.
- Frontend can be found here: https://github.com/Agrim77/rp-frontend
- Deployement can be seen at: https://rp-frontend.vercel.app
